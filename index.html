				<div class="abstract"> 
				<h5>Abstract</h5>
				<p class="abstract-content">I will present an information-theoretic framework that casts learning as universal prediction under log loss, with performance characterized by regret bounds. At the heart of this framework is a principled notion of architecture-dependent model complexity, defined in terms of the probability mass or volume of models near the data-generating process. This volume can be related to spectral properties of the Hessian or Fisher Information Matrix, enabling practical approximations. I will argue that successful learning architectures exhibit a broad range of effective complexities, which allows them to adaptively fit a wide class of functions—even in highly over-parameterized settings. This perspective offers new insights into the role of inductive biases, the effectiveness of stochastic gradient descent, and phenomena such as flat minima. The framework unifies online and batch learning, supervised and generative modeling, and applies across the stochastic realizable, agnostic, and even individual sequence settings. It also sheds light on why modern architectures—such as deep neural networks and transformers—are so successful, suggesting that their layered structure naturally leads to a broad, adaptive complexity profile. These insights point toward the possibility of designing new architectures with comparable or superior performance.
